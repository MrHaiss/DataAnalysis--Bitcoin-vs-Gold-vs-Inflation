# DataAnalysis: Bitcoin vs Gold vs Inflation
 
This is an exploration of the historical price of bitcoin/gold and an analysis of how both may function as a hedge against inflation. The data (ommitted from GIT due to the file size) is sourced from Kaggle and based off the USA.

The analysis & exploration was done using jupyter notebooks. A .html file is included along with the original .ipynb file.
